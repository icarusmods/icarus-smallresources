Icarus Modding has come out with a script with many QoL changes, that make day-to-day roleplay more realistic and more fun!
Currently, this script has (with config abilities)

- /savecar (adds any un-owned car to admins garage)
- Removes spam punching
- Removes combat rolling
- Removes blind firing
- Force flashlight state (stays on until turned off manually)
- Removes "Action mode" (stance after shooting or punching)

  ## MORE TO COME :D
